# pyber_analysis

## Project Objective: 
Using ride-sharing data from the company PyBer, to display the total weekly fares for rural, suburban, and urban cities. Any observed differences between city types can be used to inform decision making on resource allocation for PyBer. 

## Results: 
- Rural cities have less drivers and less rides but have the highest average fare per ride and the highest average fare per driver(Fig 1)
- Urban cities have the highest number of rides, highest number of drivers, yet the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is the lowest out of all 3 city types (Fig 1)
