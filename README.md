# pyber_analysis

## Project Objective: 
Using ride-sharing data from the company PyBer, to display the total weekly fares for rural, suburban, and urban cities. Any observed differences between city types can be used to inform decision making on resource allocation for PyBer. 

## Results: 
- Rural cities have less drivers and less rides but have the highest average fare per ride and the highest average fare per driver(Fig 1)
- Urban cities have the highest number of rides, highest number of drivers, yet the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is the lowest out of all 3 city types (Fig 1)

- There does appear to be slight differences in total fares week over week (Line graph), so it may be worth adding error bars to see if these differences are significant.

## Summary: 
- Recommendation #1: Based on the results of the analysis, I would recommend not allocating more drivers/resources to urban cities as the average fare per ride is the lowest out of all 3 city types ($24.53) and so PyBer is making less money per ride. 
- Recommendation #2: In contrast, it may be worth allocating more drivers/resources to rural cities as this city type has the highest average fare per ride at $34.62. 
- Recommendation #3: If there are some weeks where people are requesting more rides (on holidays perhaps), then PyBer could introduce a higher price for ride if there is high demand during those times.
